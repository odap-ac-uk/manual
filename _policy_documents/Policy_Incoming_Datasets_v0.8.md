# Introduction

The Incoming Dataset Policy and Questionnaire is a tool used when moving your dataset from the embargoed area of the platform to the non-embargoed area of the platform and is intended to capture and formalise details of your dataset for wider dissemination.

When your dataset is no longer required to be under embargo, the University of Edinburgh as the Lead Institution will become a Data Controller and facilitate the onboarding and access to the dataset to any approved researcher within ODAP to work with and build on. While embargoed data is subject to stricter controls around publication, typically researchers working on non-embargoed data are able to publish their results as soon as their research is complete.

The process of moving datasets out of embargo involved adding detailed information about the available data within these datasets to be publically available, such as the odap.ac.uk website and the HDR UK Innovation gateway. In addition, this may involve removing certain variables or patient level data from the final dataset. To ensure that these datasets are accurately described, easily located, and that no restricted variables where the embargo should not be lifted are missed, this form comes with an accompanying due diligence questionnaire about these dataset. The questionnaire is designed to capture the details we need to ensure that these datasets are safely transitioned to out of embargo area of ODAP and that it is accurately promoted.

# FAQ
