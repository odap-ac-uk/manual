# Introduction

The purpose of the Outbreak Data Analysis Platform is to provide an accessible and usable data resource to enable research that is relevant to COVID-19, including new future COVID-19 outbreaks as well as those arising from other viruses. This will accelerate scientific understanding of new outbreaks for the benefit of patients and the protection of the public.

To enable this to happen the Outbreak Data Analysis Platform (ODAP) brings together data from clinical records, research studies and audit data. ODAP is supported by UKRI and the Data and Connectivity Programme of the National Core Studies.

## Purpose

ODAP works with the help of multiple groups from data controllers to researchers in order to make the platform possible, and each of these groups require proper recognition for their contributions.

This document sets out who these groups are, how to provide proper attribution to each group, and who needs to follow these policies. This includes how contributing datasets and the use of patient data should be acknowledged, but also extends to algorithms, code, software, and methodologies generated during the course of research facilitated by ODAP.

More details about these groups and how these policies apply to them can be found in [Section 3 Groups](#_§3_Groups).

## Scope

ODAP research outputs include typical academic measures of success, such as journal publications. As publications are increasingly announced on social media platforms attribution on these platforms is also set out in this policy. To continue to improve upon the data assets stored within the Platform and the quality of the research produced via ODAP, the code, software and methodologies that facilitate the analysis of ODAP data are also covered by this policy.

[Section 4 Materials](#_§4_Materials) details which and how outputs should be attributed.

## Review

This document is authored and maintained by the ODAP data access team based within the University of Edinburgh as the lead institution.

We will keep this policy, and the attribution specifics, under review and update this policy as required.

The ODAP data access team is keen to support attribution and communication around outputs and the other assets discussed in this document. Please contact us at odap@ed.ac.uk if you need any support or clarification in this regard.

# Groups

This section documents the different user groups associated with ODAP, their relationship to ODAP, and which sections of this policy they are required to adhere to.

## Data Contributors 

### 3.1.1 Group Definition

Data Contributors are organisations formally part of the ODAP Partnership Steering Group that provide data to be stored and linked within the Platform. Data contributors may devolve authority to the Lead Institute (i.e. the University of Edinburgh) to act as the Data Controller for their data when stored within the Platform, as well as processing for onward sharing with third party researchers.

### 3.1.2 Policy Adherence

Data Contributors are required to adhere to this policy when; referencing work produced within the Platform e.g., when promoting a publication, directing users towards data stored within the Platform, or when referencing the Platform or Partnership in a public setting such as giving a presentation or discussing ODAP in the media.

## 3.2 Data Requestors

### 3.2.1 Group Definition

Data Requestors are individuals, organisations, and/or institutions that have entered into a data sharing agreement with the Lead Institute to gain access to the data within the Platform for the purpose of conducting research and analysis on the data stored within the Platform.

### 3.2.2 Policy Adherence

Data Requestors are required to adhere to this policy when; publishing work produced within the Platform or when promoting work that they have produced with the aid of the Platform or Partnership.

## 3.3 Data Processors

### 3.3.1 Group Definition

Data Processors are any groups or individuals that access and/or process data stored within the Platform.

### 3.3.2 Policy Adherence

Data Processors do not need to adhere to this policy unless they also fall within any of the other defined groups, in which case they should follow the guidance for those groups, or if they are publically presenting their work for ODAP.

# Materials

This section describes which outputs, products, assets, and/or materials related to ODAP that should be appropriately acknowledged.

## Publications

### Policy Guidance

This section details how attribution in journal publications should be handled.

#### Embargoed & Non-embargoed data

Some ODAP data sets will be under embargo for exclusive use by the researchers generating the data, for a defined period. To ensure that research teams get appropriate recognition for the effort involved in collecting and analysing data, the research team will be entitled to a limited period of exclusive use of the data they have collected to enable them to publish the results of their research.

The length of this embargo will vary however we will be transparent about which data is currently under embargo and when it is expected to be released, with the understanding that this date may change in the future.

Non-embargoed data has no such exclusive use restriction and publications may be created with this data freely subject to our Output Review Process Policy.

#### Output requests

Output requests must be submitted to the ODAP data access team who will liaise with the Data management Team for oversight before outputs can be approved to leave the Platform. The results of this oversight must be given within one week of the output request, and before any manuscript is submitted to a journal. Details of how to apply for an output are covered in the Output Review Process Policy.

#### Right to publish

All publications will adhere to the principle that for embargoed data the originating data contributor retains the right to publish their data first, recognizing the policy on attribution and acknowledging ODAP as the enabling platform as described below.

#### Pre-printing

We support the principle of pre-printing but accept there may be circumstances where this is not feasible.

#### Derived data

Researchers will be required to return research results and supporting raw data and materials (including negative results and code) to the data repository before an output will be approved as described in section: [Code and related digital artefacts](#code-and-related-digital-artefacts).

This will allow ODAP to make research results and supporting data and materials available to other researchers in such a manner that the analyses can be peer reviewed through a process of replication.

Guidance will be available to ensure data will be returned in a suitable machine-readable format compatible with ODAP’s systems into a common store of data.

### Group: Data Contributors

#### Attribution

Acknowledge the University of Edinburgh as one of the institutions to which you are affiliated:  
  
‘Supporting the Outbreak Data Analysis Platform (ODAP), which is administered and led by the University of Edinburgh in partnership with the ODAP Partnership and part of the Data and Connectivity National Core Study, and funded by UK Research and Innovation’

#### Patient & public data attribution

Include in acknowledgements or funding section use MY data’s data citation:

> ‘This work uses data provided by patients and collected by the NHS as part of their care and support’

### Group: Data Requestors

#### Attribution

Acknowledge ODAP as one of the institutions to which you are affiliated and where possible list “Outbreak Data Analysis Platform” and “ODAP” as keywords for your publication. If possible list “The Outbreak Data Analysis Platform” as one of your methods for your publication.

ODAP must be acknowledged formally in publications if ODAP resources have been used:

> ‘This work was supported by Outbreak Data Analysis Platform (ODAP), which is administered and led by the University of Edinburgh in partnership with the ODAP Partnership and part of the Data and Connectivity National Core Study, and funded by UK Research and Innovation.’

In addition to acknowledging ODAP, all publications that depend on data stored within the Platform must follow the relevant attribution and/or publication policy for each dataset used as described in section: [Acknowledging specific datasets](#acknowledging-specific-datasets).

#### Patient & public data attribution

Include in acknowledgements or funding section use MY data’s data citation:

*‘This work uses data provided by patients and collected by the NHS as part of their care and support’*

## Acknowledging specific datasets

### Group: Data Requestors

#### Attribution

In addition to acknowledging ODAP in your publication you may be required to acknowledge the individual datasets you have used within the platform. We require that all research completed within the platform follow the individual acknowledgement, authorship, and attribution policies for the datasets used within the platform.

To aide Data Requestors in properly acknowledging the contribution of datasets within the platform a list of complied Attribution and Publication policies is made available on the ODAP website.

#### Patient & Public data attribution

Highlight if your dataset has used public data and whether an attribution back to the public source is required.

## Code and related digital artefacts

This is any code (e.g., algorithms, analytical script, and source code) and related digital artefacts (e.g., documents) created over the course of a research project.

### Group: Data Requestors

#### Requirement

As part of the output approvals process the Data Requestor requiring the output will provide digital artefacts used to create or support the creation of the required output to the ODAP platform and these artefacts should be listed in the output request form.

If the output is approved these digital artefacts will be moved to the collab space in the non-embargoed of the platform area and catalogued for future reuse by other Data Requestors to support and enrich the platform.

The default license for code in the Platform collab space is the MIT license. Otherwise, similarly liberal and open source licenses (such as Apache 2.0, BSD, Eclipse Public License, etc.) should be used, permitting anyone to benefit from, improve upon and redistribute the code.

## Social Media

### Groups: Data Contributors, Data Requestors

#### Attribution

ODAP does not currently have an official presence on any social media platforms as thus can’t be tagged within a post, however acknowledge the platform by linking to <https://odap.ac.uk/> within the post.

For further guidance contact <odap@ac.uk>

#### Patient & Public data attribution

Consider including an appropriate hashtag to acknowledge use of patient/public data where appropriate, e.g., \#datasaveslives

## Promotion

This is any situation not covered by the above where work completed with the assistance of the ODAP Platform is being discussed and can include presentations of results, press releases, other events or media activity, etc.

### Groups: Data Contributors, Data Requestors, and Data Processors

Similar to our stance on social media we simply request acknowledgment when work completed within ODAP is being discussed. Please use our short attribution statement:

*“This work was supported by Outbreak Data Analysis Platform (ODAP), odap.ac.uk.”*

For guidance of what results may be presented outside of the trusted research environment please see the Output Review Process Policy document.
