# Committee

## Role of the ODAP DAGC

To approve the ODAP information governance processes proposed by
        the Lead Institute (the University of Edinburgh). This includes
        approving:

-   Scope of research within the ODAP. Changes to scope are proposed by
    the steering group and approved by the DAGC.

-   Defining limits of 'agreed research types' within scope for
    streamlined access to data in the non-embargo area.

-   Oversight of data governance processes used by the Lead Institute to
    manage the data access for agreed research types including the
    assessment criteria for access requests in the non-embargo area

-   Processes for platform ingress, and output review

-   Transparency and publication policies

-   All other aspects of ODAP information governance

    1.  Where the Lead Institute via the ODAP secretariat or the Data
        Contributor wish to obtain a second opinion on whether a request
        falls within the scope of ODAP's 'agreed research types', or
        where an applicant appeals against a decision, the request can
        be referred to ODAP DAGC who review access request material and
        return their advice to the Data Contributor and Lead Institute.

## Membership

The membership structure of ODAP DAGC is defined by the ODAP Steering
Group. The starting membership structure includes all data contributors
to the Outbreak Data Analysis Platform, representatives from the four
national Public Health Agencies, lay representatives and other non-lay
members. Each organisation should nominate a lead representative to join
the DAGC. Prospective data contributors may be invited to attend
meetings as an observer until their datasets are approved for on
boarding into ODAP. The dataset on boarding policy and process are to be
defined and agreed by the ODAP steering committee. Nominations and names
of DAGC members can be found in the Annex below.

1. **Eligibility:** Members must agree to abide by the
        Conflict-of-interest Policy and the governance framework for the
        Platform.

2.  **Term:** The DAGC members can hold their position for 3 years
    and can be re-elected for a maximum of 3 terms.

3.  **Resignation:** Members are free to resign their position with
    immediate effect. Where possible, 3 months' notice should be
    given.

4.  **Revocation:** Membership to the DAGC can be revoked by the
    ODAP Steering Group for professional misconduct and/or a breach
    of the Conflicts of Interest Policy or any other part of the
    Platform governance framework. DAGC members are asked to be
    active in their participation on the Committee. Members who
    participate in less than 20% of DAGC activities within a 6-month
    period may be asked to reconsider their involvement in the DAGC.

## Responsibilities of the ODAP DAGC Chair

1.  The Chair has responsibility for ensuring that any conflicts of
    interest are recognised and appropriately managed as above.

2.  The Chair will ensure that ODAP DAGC members are not put under
    pressure to approve or reject proposed information governance
    processes, assessment criteria or any queried applications based
    on any vested interests or conflicts of interest, and that
    applications are considered solely against the stated scope
    criteria of the ODAP DAGC.

3.  A Vice Chair will also be appointed, who will take over the
    duties of the Chair in the event that the Chair is unavailable.
    Apart from covering for the Chair, the Vice Chair has no other
    additional duties.

4.  Any member of the ODAP DAGC who isn't affiliated with funder
    (i.e. HDRUK), the Lead Institute (i.e. the University of
    Edinburgh) or data contributors can put themselves forward to
    act as Chair or Vice Chair. In the event of more than one
    nomination being received for the position, the ODAP DAGC
    members will vote, with the candidate with the majority of votes
    being elected to the position.

5.  The tenure of the Chair and Vice Chair will normally be for 3
    years renewable with the rest of ODAP DAGC's agreement. A Chair
    or Vice Chair may seek re-election to the role after this period
    if they wish to do so. Either may resign their position at any
    stage if they are unable or unwilling to continue. If the Chair
    or Vice Chair are not performing their duties appropriately, the
    chair of ODAP steering group may ask the ODAP DAGC for
    permission (by majority vote) to remove them and hold a vote to
    appoint a replacement.

## Meeting frequency

1.  Following on from a period of initial meetings to establish ODAP
    data access governance processes, ODAP DAGC will convene for 6
    monthly regular videoconference meetings to review how ODAP data
    access is functioning (as described in section 7 below), discuss
    any issues the Lead Institute wishes to raise, and carry out the
    other functions described in their role. Regular meetings will
    be scheduled 12 months in advance.

2.  When asked by the Lead Institute to review material (proposals
    for access governance processes or other requests such as review
    of an application) DAGC members will return their reviews to the
    Secretariat via email.

3.  ODAP steering group or Lead Institute may also request more
    extraordinary convening of ODAP DAGC

## Quorum

1.  To be quorate, regular ODAP DAGC meetings should include at
    least 3 members from the data contributor group, and one member
    from each other membership group (public health agencies, other
    scientific members and lay members) as well as senior
    representatives of the Lead Institute (i.e. the University of
    Edinburgh).

## Conflicts of interest

1.  Definition: These terms define \"conflict of interest\" as any
    interest that may affect or reasonably be perceived to affect
    individual objectivity and independence in providing advice to the
    Platform, or in carrying out the duties of the Data Access
    Governance Committee. An interest can be financial, business,
    research, research funding, intellectual property interest, public
    statements, positions held, employment, consultancies, directorships
    or any other interest.

2.  Declaring conflicts: DAGC members shall declare any interests in
    advance of joining the DAGC using a Conflicts of Interests form.
    This will be reviewed annually. The Chair of the DAGC will seek
    verbal confirmation at the start of any meeting that the Declaration
    of Interests of each member is current and up to date, and in
    respect to the items of business on the agenda. It is the duty of
    each member of the DAGC to declare interests not only at the start
    of meetings but as and when they arise.

3.  Managing conflicts: In assessing declared interests, the DAGC Chair
    shall balance the nature, type and magnitude of the individual's
    interest and therefore the degree to which the interest may be
    reasonably expected to influence his or her judgment against the
    adequacy of measures/options available to protect the independence
    and integrity of the decision-making process with the Platform.

4.  Should any conflict arise, these shall be managed using the possible
    courses of action listed below:

-   Recommend that the concerned individual fully participate in the
    meeting or activity and any decision-making;

-   Recommend that the concerned individual participate in the
    deliberations, but be recused from making any decisions, on the
    relevant matter under consideration;

-   Recommend that the concerned individual do not participate in both
    the deliberations and the decision-making on the relevant matter
    under consideration.

-   Recommend that the individual is not allowed to serve on a
    governance committee or Secretariat.

5.  Applications from persons associated with the Secretariat, DAGC
        members, previous members/representatives or associated persons
        will be defined as a conflict of interest and managed using the
        options above by the DAGC chair.

## Ways of working

1.  When reviewing governance process material proposed by the Lead
    Institute, the Chair will set a date for the reviews to be
    returned by DAGC. They may set a minimum requirement for how
    quickly a decision is returned e.g., within 5 working days of a
    request being referred to DAGC.

2.  The DAGC members will receive a copy of all the data access
    requests made to ODAP via the online five safes form for
    information purposes. If DAGC members wish to share concern or
    feedback on any applications, they may contact the secretariat
    within 5 working days of receiving the application. If DAGC
    members do not wish to receive copies of data access request
    applications they should contact the secretariat.

3.  If the Lead Institute wishes to call upon the DAGC for
    additional support to assess if an application falls within
    scope of ODAP 'agreed research types', the Lead Institute will
    share all materials the applicants have submitted. This includes
    the five Safes' Data Access Request form, relevant ethics
    approvals and other relevant documents.

4.  The secretariat and the Chair will set a date for review to be
    returned and nominate the ODAP DAGC members or external experts
    to request review from.

5.  The Chair will define how many members of DAGC should
    participate in reviews of applicants' data access request
    submissions. A minimum requirement will be one reviewer from
    each membership group -- data contributors, public health
    agencies, scientific members and lay members.

6.  Committee members will be free to discuss submitted data access
    requests with the chair and to raise any concerns directly with
    the Chair.

7.  In the event that any reviews requested by the Chair cannot be
    returned by committee members on time -- as long as one review
    is available across each membership group (one data contributor,
    public health agency, other scientific member and lay member),
    the chair can make a recommendation. If one review across each
    membership group is not available, the Chair must request
    additional reviews from other members of ODAP DAGC.

8.  The Chair will be responsible for liaison with the Lead
    Institute including summarising recommendations and amendments
    requested by reviewers of processes or applications for data
    access, and any other information governance feedback.

## ODAP DAGC review process and voting

1.  When meeting to approve information governance policies and
    processes, the DAGC shall use best endeavours to take decisions
    by consensus (meaning all those present in the meeting agree).
    If consensus on any decision cannot be reached, and unless the
    DAGC decides otherwise, its decisions shall be taken by a simple
    majority. Where there is no majority, the Chair shall have the
    casting vote. Each individual member has one vote

2.  When asked to support the Lead Institute on deciding whether a
    request for access is within the scope of ODAP 'agreed research
    types', or reviewing the scientific quality and suitability of a
    proposal for the platform, the DAGC will refer to the 'agreed
    research types' scope and review processes defined in ODAP
    documentation shared with the Committee. Members can vote to
    approve or reject a request for access as in or out of scope.
    Votes to approve or reject must be accompanied by a rationale.
    All votes and rationale will be visible to all members.

3.  Any request for access that receives unanimous approval from
    reviewers will be approved. An application that receives 1 or
    more votes for rejection will be returned to the applicant with
    appropriate feedback based on the rationale given by members.
    The contents of the response will be decided by the Secretariat,
    with input and endorsement of the Chair.

## Principles, Ethics Approach and Accountability

1.  The DAGC will operate a fair, transparent, equitable, efficient,
    timely, effective and well-governed system to make data
    accessible in order to facilitate research and encourage rapid
    publication.

2.  The DAGC with assistance from the Secretariat will monitor data
    access requests (both those accepted and rejected) and their
    management to ensure compliance with the Platform's data access
    processes, governance framework, ethical approvals and all
    applicable laws, governmental rules, regulations, good practices
    and guidelines.

3.  This should include consideration of the duties to not cause
    harm to individuals or groups, to respect patients' autonomy,
    patient confidentiality, the patient's right to informed
    consent, public health ethics and global emergency ethics
    considerations.

## Reporting structure and escalation process

1.  The ODAP DAGC acts in an advisory role to the University of
    Edinburgh. In the event of a dispute or serious issue arising,
    which cannot be resolved by the ODAP DAGC Chair and PI of ODAP,
    the escalation process will be the responsibility of the Lead
    Institute, who will conduct an independent investigation and
    devise an action plan to resolve the issue. This process will be
    followed for all disputes or issues whether originating within
    ODAP DAGC or from an external source (e.g. a complaint by a
    researcher).

## Terms of reference and Information Governance process review

1.  The ODAP DAGC will review its Terms of Reference and the other
        ODAP information governance processes annually, with the next
        review due in autumn 2023.
