title: Output Review Process
version: 0.3

{{< pagebreak >}}

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to outline the output review process and who is involved and responsible.

## Scope

This policy applies to researchers requesting outputs from the ODAP platform, the ODAP Access Team processing requests for outputs and the ODAP Data Management Team, providing the outputs.

## Review

This policy is managed and maintained by the ODAP data access team. It is reviewed regularly, and input is requested from the ODAP Data Access Governance Committee where appropriate.

## Outputs

Outputs can include *the results of the research/data analyses generated in the allocated ODAP workspaces.*

## The Output Review process

Output requests must be submitted to the ODAP data access team who will liaise with the data management team for oversight before outputs can be approved to leave the Platform. The results of this oversight must be given within one week after the output has been requested, and before any manuscript is submitted to a journal. The Output Review process comprises of:

- Disclosure review – review and remediate potentially identifiable information - conducted in researcher’s workspace within ODAP.

## Expectations of researchers

ODAP expects a high standard of accountability from researchers, and the output review process is in addition to this expectation.

- Researchers are responsible for safe outputs

- Researchers must be ONS-SRT accredited and have completed their on boarding training

- Researchers must check data and outputs to ensure they are safe and in line with project approval

- Researchers must provide documentation for reviewers to understand outputs

- Researchers are responsible for ensuring they follow any requirements from Data Contributors for granted data access.

# Output Review Process: Summary

## Results generated in ODAP

All analyses are approved to take place within the ODAP, and researchers will be allocated a workspace in which to do their work. This is the same workspace for outputs.

Outputs can be requested throughout the life time of the project approved by the ODAP project review panel and/or the data access governance committee. Output requests must be made using the outputs request form.

## Disclosure Review – No identifiable results

The Disclosure Review is undertaken to ensure Safe Outputs, i.e. ensure there are no disclosure risks from outputs generated and requested for export from the ODAP. The disclosure review is inclusive of the output review process and mandatory for each output request.

This step should consider any linkage that may be possible from results with other data sets

<u>Responsibility:</u> ODAP Access Team, Stats group expert (if required) via nomination from the Project Review Panel and/or the Data Access Governance Committee (DAGC).

A disclosure review can be:

- Mandated by the Data Contributor (members of DAGC)

- Recommended by the ODAP Project Review Panel who reviewed original project proposal, due to:

  - Access to sensitive / controversial data

  - Sample size

  - Rarity of events

  - Geographic area

- Requested by the PI / Research Lead, with rationale

## Decisions

Results approved for export:

ODAP data management team, on instruction from the data access team, safely export the requested outputs to the researcher/research team.

Results declined for export:

If a review is not approved, feedback will be shared with researchers, who will have an opportunity to amend and resubmit.
