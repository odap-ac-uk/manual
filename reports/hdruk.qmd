<!--

This is a revised summary plan, consistent with the content and objectives of the peer-reviewed Pandemics and Outbreaks Programme, which scored 10/10 in the HDR UK Quinquennial Review. Here we clarify the new leadership after Sharon Peacock's departure, and provide details of who will take responsibility for specific deliverables. 

-->

*Co-leads: Kenneth Baillie, Steve Harris, and Emma Thompson.*

# Funding

This driver programme was reviewed as part of the HDR UK Quinquennial review. It scored 10/10. Activity has been paused because of an overall funding shortfall in the HDR UK bid, due to the withdrawal of the Wellcome from the pool of funders. 

The total cost of the proposed work is Â£5M.

# Background
<!--
In any new outbreak, there are common steps in the progession of knowledge:

**Phase 1.** an unusual pattern of disease is noticed by a single clinician seeing multiple cases.  
**Phase 2.** detailed knowledge is shared by clinicians and public health teams discussing cases in detail (e.g. public health conference calls).  
**Phase 3.** analysis of structured data at population scale, identification of risk factors (e.g. [ISARIC CCP](isaric4c.net)).  
**Phase 4.** integrated deep biological characterisation, therapeutics (e.g. [GenOMICC](genomicc.org), ISARIC CCP, RECOVERY).  

UK biomedical research infrastructure is designed for perennial clinical problems, in which the frontier of knowledge is in phase 4. In outbreaks, there are unmet needs across all four phases. 
-->

Our approach is to optimise peacetime academic infrastructure to deliver fast, efficient delivery of answers to key clinical questions by improving, testing and, most importantly, actually *using* data and sampling capability across the four nations of the UK during the inter-pandemic period.

The design of the Pandemics and Outbreaks Driver Programme was based on the following core principles:

1. **Distributed data analysis** using secure multi-party compute can answer immediate questions in outbreaks  
2. **Central data collation** will continue to be required for computationally intensive applications: host/pathogen genomics, deep phenotyping, data integration, machine learning/AI.  
3. **Perennial problems** must be the focus in order to "keep the engine running": AMR, sepsis, research recruitment, sample acquisition and small-scale outbreaks.  
4. **Critical care** exemplifies challenges and opportunities across secondary care.  
5. **The academic sector** provides essential scalable resource and cutting edge technology to public health in emergencies.  

# Advancing sovereign data infrastructure during peacetime.

We will build the following key infrastructure capabilities:

-  Establish internal software "pharmacies" within NHS systems (in collaboration with Microsoft). **Sustainability plan: commercialise**
-  Demonstrate and deliver secure multi-party compute between exemplar NHS systems and the [Outbreak Data Analysis Platform (ODAP)](odap.ac.uk) **Sustainability plan: open source/commercialise**
-  Efficient transfer, where necessary, of clinical, microbiological and host genomic information to the ODAP **Sustainability plan: cost-recovery data access model**

# Key data feeds from across HDR UK infrastructure

- electronic case report form from within NHS hospitals (@sec-distributed)
- lab results (national pathology) (@sec-centralised)
- medications data (@sec-lab)

# Geographical distribution

## Digitally-mature sites

The work in @sec-distributed will be focused on carefully-selected digitally-mature hospital sites. We aim to demonstrate what is possible with the best tools, in the expectation that they will be available widely within 10 years. 

- University College Hospital London
- NHS Lothian
- ODAP ([See the ODAP manual for full summary of the project](https://odap.ac.uk/manual/auto-generated/ODAP_manual.pdf))
- MRC Centre for Virology Research, Glasgow

## UK-wide

We will build systems to gather minimal information from electronic systems in all sites in the UK using pragmatic methodology (e.g. manual data entry using ISARIC Clinical Characterisation Protocol (CCP),  National Pathology Exchange blood results linkage to unconsented and consented studies - @sec-unconsented-central).

## Worldwide

We will design and test clinical surveillance in critical care, providing proof-of-concept for sharing of a minimal informative dataset without a multiparty legal agreement, and share software, know-how and legal templates with international partners.

<!--
## Automated feedback to NHS

1. Outputs from analyses:
    - Embedded link between host and microbiological samples
	- AMR risk
2. Sample acquisition from local laboratory
-->

<!--
## Automate clinical data collection

1. **Data obtained wihout individual consent** - for enhanced clinical surveillance. *Minimal informative dataset* to facilitate research into surveillance methods.
1. **Data obtained wihout individual consent** - for enhanced clinical characterisation at aggregate level using secure multi-party computation
3. **Data obtained wihout individual consent** - for clinical characterisation of outbreaks during public health event - requires activation from government like COPI notice
3. **Data obtained with informed consent** - enables data to be available for all trials and consented observational studies. e.g. blood results, clinical characterisation.

# Data transfer vs federated analysis

## Data transfer (ODAP)

Limited data transfer to ODAP is necessary to:

1. Enable linkage with research data
2. Enable computationally-intesive analyses. e.g.: host/pathogen genomics, prognostic modelling, AI.

## Federated analytics/ secure multiparty compute
# Work packages

## Eligibility/inclusion criteria, phenotypes [Baillie]

## Laboratory sample transfer network for research [Thompson]

## Secure Multiparty Compute [Kerr]

## NHS data analytics for AMR [Harris]

## Template legal agreements [Haniffa]

## Forecast impact of outbreak [Beane]

## Unusual case button [Beane]

## AI data bucket parser

Take data in multiple formats and parse it into standard format. e.g. Nursing staff rotas; laboratory data
