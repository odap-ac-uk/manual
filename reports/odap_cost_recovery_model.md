title: ODAP cost recovery model
---

The ODAP cost recovery model is based on the 5 safes framework. The 5 safes are safe data, safe projects, safe people, safe settings, and safe outputs. 

The cost recovery model includes both core and direct costs. Core costs are the minimum support costs that are needed for the general running of our platform. Core costs need to support and maintain the activities and functions of EPCC, Public Health Scotland, and the ODAP administration team. Direct costs are costs that we are able to attribute in full to one single data access as described in 'Charges for access to ODAP Open data collection'. Direct costs are allocated to researchers accessing the data.

## Core costs

To maintain current data storage and infrastructure, linkage, access, and support for researchers the following costs will need to be incurred.


| Description                       | Resource          | Cost per annum     | 
| :---                              | :---              | :---               |
| Data infrastructure and storage   | EPCC 			    | £25,000.00		 | 
| Researcher support and use of NSH | PHS               | £33,755.50         |
| Data linkage                      | PHS               |                    | 
| Disclosure control                | PHS               |                    |
| Administration 					| 0.4FTE ODAP admin | £10,380.00         |
| Total core cost per annum			|					| £63,945.00         |	


## Direct costs

### Charges for access to ODAP Open data collection

ODAP Open receives funding from HDR UK, the Medical Research Council and the University of Edinburgh to support core activities. These activities include infrastructure and maintaining current processes and do not extend to providing support for new and individual projects. Researchers will be expected to meet any and all costs for data access and provision. All researchers accessing ODAP Open data will be charged on a cost recovery basis unless a grant proposal is being submitted.  

 
This cost will vary depending on the number of atomic and/or compound data sets requested and the amount of time required to facilitate your request. Once a proposal has been approved and the applicant informed of the cost these are non-negotiable. 
 

Costs will be determined for each individual project and will reflect only the true cost to ODAP of providing the data requested. Once a proposal has been agreed in principle, a full and accurate costing will be provided. Current charges for data requests are provided in table 1, with example costings.  

 
There are three types of charges for data access:

1. Basic costs for atomic datasets that are readily available 

2. Bespoke data or new compound datasets that require additional work to release  

3. Amendments to an original request  

If a project is more complex and require more resource than typically expected, we reserve the right to charge additional costs not detailed in Table 1. These costs will be discussed with researchers in advance as required.  
 

Costs are reviewed on a regular basis. Costs that are quoted are therefore accurate at the time they are provided, and it is the researcher’s responsibility to check that costs haven’t changed if there is a significant lapse in time between obtaining the quote and starting the project.  VAT will be charged in addition to the table costs, where applicable.
