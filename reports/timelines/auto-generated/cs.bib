 abstract = {Rationale: In life-threatening coronavirus disease (COVID-19), corticosteroids reduce mortality, suggesting that immune responses have a causal role in death. Whether this deleterious inflammation is primarily a direct reaction to the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or an independent immunopathologic process is unknown.Objectives: To determine SARS-CoV-2 organotropism and organ-specific inflammatory responses and the relationships among viral presence, inflammation, and organ injury.Methods: Tissue was acquired from 11 detailed postmortem examinations. SARS-CoV-2 organotropism was mapped by using multiplex PCR and sequencing, with cellular resolution achieved by in situ viral S (spike) protein detection. Histologic evidence of inflammation was quantified from 37 anatomic sites, and the pulmonary immune response was characterized by using multiplex immunofluorescence.Measurements and Main Results: Multiple aberrant immune responses in fatal COVID-19 were found, principally involving the lung and reticuloendothelial system, and these were not clearly topologically associated with the virus. Inflammation and organ dysfunction did not map to the tissue and cellular distribution of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein between or within tissues. An arteritis was identified in the lung, which was further characterized as a monocyte/myeloid-rich vasculitis, and occurred together with an influx of macrophage/monocyte-lineage cells into the pulmonary parenchyma. In addition, stereotyped abnormal reticuloendothelial responses, including excessive reactive plasmacytosis and iron-laden macrophages, were present and dissociated from viral presence in lymphoid tissues.Conclusions: Tissue-specific immunopathology occurs in COVID-19, implicating a significant component of the immune-mediated, virus-independent immunopathologic process as a primary mechanism in severe disease. Our data highlight novel immunopathologic mechanisms and validate ongoing and future efforts to therapeutically target aberrant macrophage and plasma-cell responses as well as promote pathogen tolerance in COVID-19.},

 abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Background{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}COVID-19 is a multisystem disease and patients who survive might have in-hospital complications. These complications are likely to have important short-term and long-term consequences for patients, health-care utilisation, health-care system preparedness, and society amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our aim was to characterise the extent and effect of COVID-19 complications, particularly in those who survive, using the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We did a prospective, multicentre cohort study in 302 UK health-care facilities. Adult patients aged 19 years or older, with confirmed or highly suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to COVID-19 were included in the study. The primary outcome of this study was the incidence of in-hospital complications, defined as organ-specific diagnoses occurring alone or in addition to any hallmarks of COVID-19 illness. We used multilevel logistic regression and survival models to explore associations between these outcomes and in-hospital complications, age, and pre-existing comorbidities.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Between Jan 17 and Aug 4, 2020, 80 388 patients were included in the study. Of the patients admitted to hospital for management of COVID-19, 49{$\cdot$}7\% (36 367 of 73 197) had at least one complication. The mean age of our cohort was 71{$\cdot$}1 years (SD 18{$\cdot$}7), with 56{$\cdot$}0\% (41 025 of 73 197) being male and 81{$\cdot$}0\% (59 289 of 73 197) having at least one comorbidity. Males and those aged older than 60 years were most likely to have a complication (aged {$\geq$}60 years: 54{$\cdot$}5\% [16 579 of 30 416] in males and 48{$\cdot$}2\% [11 707 of 24 288] in females; aged {$<$}60 years: 48{$\cdot$}8\% [5179 of 10 609] in males and 36{$\cdot$}6\% [2814 of 7689] in females). Renal (24{$\cdot$}3\%, 17 752 of 73 197), complex respiratory (18{$\cdot$}4\%, 13 486 of 73 197), and systemic (16{$\cdot$}3\%, 11 895 of 73 197) complications were the most frequent. Cardiovascular (12{$\cdot$}3\%, 8973 of 73 197), neurological (4{$\cdot$}3\%, 3115 of 73 197), and gastrointestinal or liver (0{$\cdot$}8\%, 7901 of 73 197) complications were also reported.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Complications and worse functional outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 are high, even in young, previously healthy individuals. Acute complications are associated with reduced ability to self-care at discharge, with neurological complications being associated with the worst functional outcomes. COVID-19 complications are likely to cause a substantial strain on health and social care in the coming years. These data will help in the design and provision of services aimed at the post-hospitalisation care of patients with COVID-19.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}National Institute for Health Research and the UK Medical Research Council.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

 abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Background{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Early in the pandemic it was suggested that pre-existing use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could lead to increased disease severity in patients with COVID-19. NSAIDs are an important analgesic, particularly in those with rheumatological disease, and are widely available to the general public without prescription. Evidence from community studies, administrative data, and small studies of hospitalised patients suggest NSAIDs are not associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes. We aimed to characterise the safety of NSAIDs and identify whether pre-existing NSAID use was associated with increased severity of COVID-19 disease.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}This prospective, multicentre cohort study included patients of any age admitted to hospital with a confirmed or highly suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to COVID-19 between Jan 17 and Aug 10, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes were disease severity at presentation, admission to critical care, receipt of invasive ventilation, receipt of non-invasive ventilation, use of supplementary oxygen, and acute kidney injury. NSAID use was required to be within the 2 weeks before hospital admission. We used logistic regression to estimate the effects of NSAIDs and adjust for confounding variables. We used propensity score matching to further estimate effects of NSAIDS while accounting for covariate differences in populations.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Results{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Between Jan 17 and Aug 10, 2020, we enrolled 78 674 patients across 255 health-care facilities in England, Scotland, and Wales. 72 179 patients had death outcomes available for matching; 40 406 (56{$\cdot$}2\%) of 71 915 were men, 31 509 (43{$\cdot$}8\%) were women. In this cohort, 4211 (5{$\cdot$}8\%) patients were recorded as taking systemic NSAIDs before admission to hospital. Following propensity score matching, balanced groups of NSAIDs users and NSAIDs non-users were obtained (4205 patients in each group). At hospital admission, we observed no significant differences in severity between exposure groups. After adjusting for explanatory variables, NSAID use was not associated with worse in-hospital mortality (matched OR 0{$\cdot$}95, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}84\textendash 1{$\cdot$}07; p=0{$\cdot$}35), critical care admission (1{$\cdot$}01, 0{$\cdot$}87\textendash 1{$\cdot$}17; p=0{$\cdot$}89), requirement for invasive ventilation (0{$\cdot$}96, 0{$\cdot$}80\textendash 1{$\cdot$}17; p=0{$\cdot$}69), requirement for non-invasive ventilation (1{$\cdot$}12, 0{$\cdot$}96\textendash 1{$\cdot$}32; p=0{$\cdot$}14), requirement for oxygen (1{$\cdot$}00, 0{$\cdot$}89\textendash 1{$\cdot$}12; p=0{$\cdot$}97), or occurrence of acute kidney injury (1{$\cdot$}08, 0{$\cdot$}92\textendash 1{$\cdot$}26; p=0{$\cdot$}33).{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}NSAID use is not associated with higher mortality or increased severity of COVID-19.

@techreport{harrisonethnicityoutcomescovid192020,
 abstract = {Background: Reports of ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 outcomes are conflicting and the reasons for any differences in outcomes are unclear. We investigated ethnic inequalities in critical care admission patterns, the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and in-hospital mortality, among hospitalised patients with COVID-19.  Methods: We undertook a prospective cohort study in which dedicated research staff recruited hospitalised patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 from 260 hospitals across England, Scotland and Wales, collecting data directly and from records between 6th  February and 8th  May 2020 with follow-up until 22nd  May 2020. Analysis used hierarchical regression models accounting for confounding, competing risks, and clustering of patients in hospitals. Potential mediators for death were explored with a three-way decomposition mediation analysis.  Findings: Of 34,986 patients enrolled, 30,693 (88\%) had ethnicity recorded: South Asian (1,388, 5\%), East Asian (266, 1\%), Black (1,094, 4\%), Other Ethnic Minority (2,398, 8\%) (collectively Ethnic Minorities), and White groups (25,547, 83\%). Ethnic Minorities were younger and more likely to have diabetes (type 1/type 2) but had fewer other comorbidities such as chronic heart disease or dementia than the White group. No difference was seen between ethnic groups in the time from symptom onset to hospital admission, nor in illness severity at admission.  Critical care admission was more common in South Asian (odds ratio 1.28, 95\% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.52), Black (1.36, 1.14 to 1.62), and Other Ethnic Minority (1.29, 1.13 to 1.47) groups compared to the White group, after adjusting for age, sex and location. This was broadly unchanged after adjustment for deprivation and comorbidities. Patterns were similar for IMV.  Higher adjusted mortality was seen in the South Asian (hazard ratio 1.19, 1.05 to 1.36), but not East Asian (1.00, 0.74 to 1.35), Black (1.05, 0.91 to 1.26) or Other Ethnic Minority (0.99, 0.89 to 1.10) groups, compared to the White group. 18\% (95\% CI, 9\% to 56\%) of the excess mortality in South Asians was mediated by pre-existing diabetes.  Interpretation: Ethnic Minorities in hospital with COVID-19 were more likely to be admitted to critical care and receive IMV than Whites, despite similar disease severity on admission, similar duration of symptoms, and being younger with fewer comorbidities. South Asians are at greater risk of dying, due at least in part to a higher prevalence of pre-existing diabetes.

 abstract = {Objective To develop and validate a pragmatic risk score to predict mortality in patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). Design Prospective observational cohort study. Setting International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) study (performed by the ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium\textemdash ISARIC-4C) in 260 hospitals across England, Scotland, and Wales. Model training was performed on a cohort of patients recruited between 6 February and 20 May 2020, with validation conducted on a second cohort of patients recruited after model development between 21 May and 29 June 2020. Participants Adults (age {$\geq$}18 years) admitted to hospital with covid-19 at least four weeks before final data extraction. Main outcome measure In-hospital mortality. Results 35 463 patients were included in the derivation dataset (mortality rate 32.2\%) and 22 361 in the validation dataset (mortality rate 30.1\%). The final 4C Mortality Score included eight variables readily available at initial hospital assessment: age, sex, number of comorbidities, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, level of consciousness, urea level, and C reactive protein (score range 0-21 points). The 4C Score showed high discrimination for mortality (derivation cohort: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.79, 95\% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.79; validation cohort: 0.77, 0.76 to 0.77) with excellent calibration (validation: calibration-in-the-large=0, slope=1.0). Patients with a score of at least 15 (n=4158, 19\%) had a 62\% mortality (positive predictive value 62\%) compared with 1\% mortality for those with a score of 3 or less (n=1650, 7\%; negative predictive value 99\%). Discriminatory performance was higher than 15 pre-existing risk stratification scores (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve range 0.61-0.76), with scores developed in other covid-19 cohorts often performing poorly (range 0.63-0.73). Conclusions An easy-to-use risk stratification score has been developed and validated based on commonly available parameters at hospital presentation. The 4C Mortality Score outperformed existing scores, showed utility to directly inform clinical decision making, and can be used to stratify patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 into different management groups. The score should be further validated to determine its applicability in other populations. Study registration ISRCTN66726260},

 abstract = {Host-mediated lung inflammation is present1, and drives mortality2, in the critical illness caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Host genetic variants associated with critical illness may identify mechanistic targets for therapeutic development3. Here we report the results of the GenOMICC (Genetics Of Mortality In Critical Care) genome-wide association study in 2,244 critically ill patients with COVID-19 from 208 UK intensive care units. We have identified and replicated the following new genome-wide significant associations: on chromosome 12q24.13 (rs10735079, P = 1.65 \texttimes{} 10-8) in a gene cluster that encodes antiviral restriction enzyme activators (OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3); on chromosome 19p13.2 (rs74956615, P = 2.3 \texttimes{} 10-8) near the gene that encodes tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2); on chromosome 19p13.3 (rs2109069, P = 3.98 \texttimes{}  10-12) within the gene that encodes dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9); and on chromosome 21q22.1 (rs2236757, P = 4.99 \texttimes{} 10-8) in the interferon receptor gene IFNAR2. We identified potential targets for repurposing of licensed medications: using Mendelian randomization, we found evidence that low expression of IFNAR2, or high expression of TYK2, are associated with life-threatening disease; and transcriptome-wide association in lung tissue revealed that high expression of the monocyte\textendash macrophage chemotactic receptor CCR2 is associated with severe COVID-19. Our results identify robust genetic signals relating to key host antiviral defence mechanisms and mediators of inflammatory organ damage in COVID-19. Both mechanisms may be amenable to targeted treatment with existing drugs. However, large-scale randomized clinical trials will be essential before any change to clinical practice.},

We studied T cell memory in 42 patients following recovery from COVID-19 (28 with mild disease and 14 with severe disease) and 16 unexposed donors, using interferon-{$\gamma$}-based assays with peptides spanning SARS-CoV-2 except ORF1. The breadth and magnitude of T cell responses were significantly higher in severe as compared with mild cases. Total and spike-specific T cell responses correlated with spike-specific antibody responses. We identified 41 peptides containing CD4+ and/or CD8+ epitopes, including six immunodominant regions. Six optimized CD8+ epitopes were defined, with peptide\textendash MHC pentamer-positive cells displaying the central and effector memory phenotype. In mild cases, higher proportions of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells were observed. The identification of T cell responses associated with milder disease will support an understanding of protective immunity and highlights the potential of including non-spike proteins within future COVID-19 vaccine design.},

Patients with a confirmed or clinician-defined high likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection were eligible for inclusion in the ISARIC WHO CCP-UK study. For this specific study, we excluded patients with a recorded negative SARS-CoV-2 test result and those without a recorded outcome at 28 days after admission. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, therapeutic, and outcome data were collected using a prespecified case report form. Organisms considered clinically insignificant were excluded.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We analysed data from 48 902 patients admitted to hospital between Feb 6 and June 8, 2020.

Microbiological investigations were recorded for 8649 (17{$\cdot$}7\%) of 48 902 patients, with clinically significant COVID-19-related respiratory or bloodstream culture results recorded for 1107 patients. 762 (70{$\cdot$}6\%) of 1080 infections were secondary, occurring more than 2 days after hospital admission. \emph{Staphylococcus aureus} and \emph{Haemophilus influenzae} were the most common pathogens causing respiratory co-infections (diagnosed {$\leq$}2 days after admission), with Enterobacteriaceae and \emph{S aureus} most common in secondary respiratory infections. Bloodstream infections were most frequently caused by \emph{Escherichia coli} and \emph{S aureus}. Among patients with available data, 13 390 (37{$\cdot$}0\%) of 36 145 had received antimicrobials in the community for this illness episode before hospital admission and 39 258 (85{$\cdot$}2\%) of 46 061 patients with inpatient antimicrobial data received one or more antimicrobials at some point during their admission (highest for patients in critical care).

 abstract = {Immunopathology occurs in the lung and spleen in fatal COVID-19, involving monocytes/macrophages and plasma cells. Anti-inflammatory therapy reduces mortality but additional therapeutic targets are required. We aimed to gain mechanistic insight into COVID-19 immunopathology by targeted proteomic analysis of pulmonary and splenic tissues. Lung parenchymal and splenic tissue was obtained from 13 post-mortem examinations of patients with fatal COVID-19. Control tissue was obtained from cancer resection samples (lung) and deceased organ donors (spleen). Protein was extracted from tissue by phenol extraction. Olink\textregistered{} multiplex immunoassay panels were used for protein detection and quantification. Proteins with increased abundance in the lung included MCP-3, antiviral TRIM21 and pro-thrombotic TYMP. OSM and EN-RAGE/S100A12 abundance was correlated, and associated with inflammation severity. Unsupervised clustering identified `early viral' and `late inflammatory' clusters with distinct protein abundance profiles, and differences in illness duration prior to death and presence of viral RNA. In the spleen, lymphocyte chemotactic factors and CD8A were decreased in abundance, and pro-apoptotic factors were increased. B-cell receptor signalling pathway components and macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSF-1) were also increased. Additional evidence for a sub-set of host factors (including DDX58, OSM, TYMP, IL-18, MCP-3 and CSF-1) was provided by overlap between (i) differential abundance in spleen and lung tissue, (ii) meta-analysis of existing datasets, and (iii) plasma proteomic data. This proteomic analysis of lung parenchymal and splenic tissue from fatal COVID-19 provides mechanistic insight into tissue anti-viral responses, inflammation and disease stages, macrophage involvement, pulmonary thrombosis, splenic B-cell activation and lymphocyte depletion.

 abstract = {Objective To characterise the clinical features of children and young people admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the UK and explore factors associated with admission to critical care, mortality, and development of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adolescents temporarily related to coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) (MIS-C). Design Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real time analysis. Setting 260 hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland between 17 January and 3 July 2020, with a minimum follow-up time of two weeks (to 17 July 2020). Participants 651 children and young people aged less than 19 years admitted to 138 hospitals and enrolled into the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emergency Infections Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK study with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Main outcome measures Admission to critical care (high dependency or intensive care), in-hospital mortality, or meeting the WHO preliminary case definition for MIS-C. Results Median age was 4.6 (interquartile range 0.3-13.7) years, 35\% (225/651) were under 12 months old, and 56\% (367/650) were male. 57\% (330/576) were white, 12\% (67/576) South Asian, and 10\% (56/576) black. 42\% (276/651) had at least one recorded comorbidity. A systemic mucocutaneous-enteric cluster of symptoms was identified, which encompassed the symptoms for the WHO MIS-C criteria. 18\% (116/632) of children were admitted to critical care. On multivariable analysis, this was associated with age under 1 month (odds ratio 3.21, 95\% confidence interval 1.36 to 7.66; P=0.008), age 10-14 years (3.23, 1.55 to 6.99; P=0.002), and black ethnicity (2.82, 1.41 to 5.57; P=0.003). Six (1\%) of 627 patients died in hospital, all of whom had profound comorbidity. 11\% (52/456) met the WHO MIS-C criteria, with the first patient developing symptoms in mid-March. Children meeting MIS-C criteria were older (median age 10.7 (8.3-14.1) v 1.6 (0.2-12.9) years; P{$<$}0.001) and more likely to be of non-white ethnicity (64\% (29/45) v 42\% (148/355); P=0.004). Children with MIS-C were five times more likely to be admitted to critical care (73\% (38/52) v 15\% (62/404); P{$<$}0.001). In addition to the WHO criteria, children with MIS-C were more likely to present with fatigue (51\% (24/47) v 28\% (86/302); P=0.004), headache (34\% (16/47) v 10\% (26/263); P{$<$}0.001), myalgia (34\% (15/44) v 8\% (21/270); P{$<$}0.001), sore throat (30\% (14/47) v (12\% (34/284); P=0.003), and lymphadenopathy (20\% (9/46) v 3\% (10/318); P{$<$}0.001) and to have a platelet count of less than 150 \texttimes{} 109/L (32\% (16/50) v 11\% (38/348); P{$<$}0.001) than children who did not have MIS-C. No deaths occurred in the MIS-C group. Conclusions Children and young people have less severe acute covid-19 than adults. A systemic mucocutaneous-enteric symptom cluster was also identified in acute cases that shares features with MIS-C. This study provides additional evidence for refining the WHO MIS-C preliminary case definition. Children meeting the MIS-C criteria have different demographic and clinical features depending on whether they have acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (polymerase chain reaction positive) or are post-acute (antibody positive).

 abstract = {While it is now widely accepted that host inflammatory responses contribute to lung injury, the pathways that drive severity and distinguish coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from other viral lung diseases remain poorly characterized. We analyzed plasma samples from 471 hospitalized patients recruited through the prospective multicenter ISARIC4C study and 39 outpatients with mild disease, enabling extensive characterization of responses across a full spectrum of COVID-19 severity. Progressive elevation of levels of numerous inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (including IL-6, CXCL10, and GM-CSF) were associated with severity and accompanied by elevated markers of endothelial injury and thrombosis. Principal component and network analyses demonstrated central roles for IL-6 and GM-CSF in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Comparing these profiles to archived samples from patients with fatal influenza, IL-6 was equally elevated in both conditions whereas GM-CSF was prominent only in COVID-19. These findings further identify the key inflammatory, thrombotic, and vascular factors that characterize and distinguish severe and fatal COVID-19. GM-CSF is elevated early, scaled with severity, and is central to the inflammatory response in COVID-19, but not severe influenza. GM-CSF is elevated early, scaled with severity, and is central to the inflammatory response in COVID-19, but not severe influenza.},
