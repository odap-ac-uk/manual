From Wilna sept 2022:

There is currently 1 ISARIC PBPP allowing linkages to all Scottish data that Annemarie submitted and have oversight of for the consortium area (or 2073-space)

I will 
submit a new application with a 12-month end-date 
clearly write out that ODAP will take over the governance and access arrangements in the future
expand the PBPP to include other emerging infections or risks to public health, beyond Covid
include details of the new protocol and changes made
review the list of datasets we link to and check the timeframe of data extracts
describe linkages to NHSD and PHOSP, and any other studies 
describe access to external requests for instance IDAMAC requests
check the list of consortium members who have access and line this up with other approvals; provide this in an excel spreadsheet
I will also work with Oxford and Annemarie and team to check the ISARIC DPIA that will go hand-in-hand with this PBPP application.
